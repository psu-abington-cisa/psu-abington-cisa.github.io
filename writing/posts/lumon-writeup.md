## Summary

The lab runs on a Linux server hosting a web server and an FTP server, with SSH also enabled. The foothold consists of gathering a list of usernames and performing a password attack on the server to get access via SSH. The second account's credentials are stored in a backup file, and the SUID bit is set on `/bin/bash`, so the root path is straightforward. That said, the machine is full of rabbit holes.

## Scanning and enumeration

We began with an Nmap scan, found 3 services running, and noticed that the server is running Linux:

We first took a look at the FTP server and found a list of users:

```

These are the files we downloaded, from which one could build a list of users to try bruteforcing:

Subject: Intranet Migration Complete

The intranet has been migrated to the new server successfully.
All department pages are now accessible at the usual address.

Please report any display issues or broken links to IT immediately.

REMINDER: The development repository used during migration should
have been cleaned up. If you still see any .git artifacts or
leftover development files on the web server, notify me immediately
so I can remove them. This is a compliance issue.

Additionally, the MDR terminal has been updated. All refiners should
verify their access before the next work cycle.

```

We took a look at the website to see what's there and found an admin page and a login page:

At this point we ended up doing a directory busting attack on the website and uncovered an exposed .git repository, hoping to find credentials stored there:

Upon discovering the exposed repository, we began googling to understand how it could be used to access the repository, or at least get a set of credentials, which landed us on [exposed .git](https://dev.to/k1ven/how-to-explore-an-exposed-git-57m3).

## Exploitation

Turns out one could grab the repository using a tool called [gitdumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper), which would allow us to navigate the repository's files and folders.

```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/lumen/share]
└─# ./gitdumper.sh http://10.64.128.39:9999/.git/ git-directory

# GitDumper is part of https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools

Now we could see the changes made to the repository, then cat out the exact code with the line changes marked:

```

Upon logging in, we found a search bar vulnerable to SQLi, so we did some enumeration to find which database it was using, so we could send the right payloads:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912194038.png)

As there were 4 columns, we tried querying three numbers and the data we wanted, which gave us the table names and their column names:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912034358.png)

We were able to read the first flag and other information, including the usernames and bcrypt password hashes. bcrypt takes a long time to crack, so rather than cracking them offline we trimmed the list of users we found, dropped the unlikely ones, and ran a hydra password attack against the server's SSH, which would be faster:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912041206.png)

## Foothold

After gathering the hashes and the list of users, we ran a password attack against SSH using that user list and the rockyou.txt password list:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912195114.png)

Upon logging in with the valid SSH credentials, we did some digging and found cleartext credentials in a backup file:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912195333.png)

We then used those to log in as that user and grab their flag:

![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020260912195914.png)

## Privilege Escalation

We then proceeded to the last phase, privilege escalation, which was fairly easy, as the bash binary had the SUID bit set, allowing any user to run it with -p to elevate their privileges and grab the last flag.

You might fall into a lot of rabbit holes attempting this lab.

Thanks for reading.
